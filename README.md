## Steps to Setup a Canon Printer

1. Firstly, remove the Canon printer from its packing box very carefully as the Printer is fragile and contains delicate, spare parts inside it.
2. You will observe the numerous orange tapes on the canon printer (these tapes are there to secure the extendable appendages of the Printer), remove the tapes.
3. Open the front cover of the canon printer by slightly pushing it diagonally downwards (sloping down movement of the hand).
4. Remove the orange tape inside the Printer with the orange-colored protective material so that the Printer can work properly.
5. Turn the Printer to see the backside and remove the similar orange-colored protective material from the rear end by simply pulling it outwards.
6. Connect the main power cord to the Printer. You will find the power cord socket on the rear end of the Canon Printer. Also, connect the additional USB cable to the computer system and the other end to the Printer to connect the Printer to the system (if your Printer is not wireless).
7. Close the front cover of the Printer and Press the on button on the top of the Printer.
8. Fill in the cartridges with ink, and the Printer is ready to work.
